                shop and that I interact with on a day to day basis.</p>

                would I know, I'm just rolling along. You'll be fine, people will accept you, just be prepared to fight words with
                words.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="section">
                <p class="title">Plans</p>
                <p class="text">I will be going to college, Likely between my top 3 in order, Clark, WPI, and Fitchburg State. I will be going for Game
                Design, and will be working in IT while in college. I'll go for at least my bachelors, maybe my master's, and hopefully
                get an internship at Riot Games before I graduate. From there, I will work until I can start my own studio here in New
                England. From there, I'll figure it out as I go with the ideas I have.</p>

            <div class="section">
                <p class="title">Reflection</p>
                <p class="text">Some quick advice. Do your work, learn as much as you can. Use the resources you have, the certs, the equipment in shop.
                Even if you don't think you'll like it, try it. I wouldn't have known I like art so much without trying. Another thing,
                learn Photoshop. It's always useful to know how to edit a photo, especially to clean up a photo for a resume, senior
                portrait, etc. Lastly, use this time to make memories. Life will just get more stressful as you get older, so use this
                time now to ensure you won't regret not doing enough when you're older.</p>
