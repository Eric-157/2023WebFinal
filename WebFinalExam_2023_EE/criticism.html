                <p class="text">To preface, I will never forget my time in CPWD, and what I've been able to accomplish I never would have accomplished if not in CPWD. But overall I find there is still dissatisfaction, which most may be out of our control due to state requirements. But even still, I believe it's still a good idea to have something written that can be looked back upon and used as reference for improvements or changes if there is ever a time where there's conversation of change or improvements. 
                <br><br>
                First off, starting off with good things that should be continued. Overall, the freedom of our shop is amazing, and it allows for self growth and discovery. This ties in with ALE which is great. Giving students the chance to learn what they want to learn for a grade is what school should be doing. And CPWD encouraging this innate desire to learn is what helps it stand out from the rest of the shops. The only thing I could say to improve ALE is to simply have more resources. More technology or access to software for students to use. Even if only one student every 4 years uses it, having it in just in case of that 1 scenario is important. And also promoting said resources to students so they know they're there. And while having a project to showcase it would also be helpful, that's one of those as it happens, document it kind of things.
                <br><br>
                And that goes into another great thing about shop, the access to resources. We have an ever expanding library of technology to learn with, and as people utilize them, we get chances to show students that they can do it too. I can't really say much besides just continue how you've handled it so far. When you get a grant ask the students about some of the new tech and see if there is something worth buying. It's a great system already, and it encourages people to keep up to date with tech news which is important for our field. So all in all, amazing job.
                <br><br>
                And before getting into the more hard hitting topics, some lighter topics that may be out of our control is the curriculum. It could use some work to put it bluntly. On the web side, it could be condensed. As we've been seeing with the newer classes, they come in already knowing some html and css. If this continues, it might make sense to shorten the time spent on html and css lessons and move onto more practice with projects/commissions. And with the extra time, there can be more time spent towards JavaScript, as it's not given to the students in a manner that is in depth. As for how to do this, w3schools has all the resources needed, they have free lessons with practices on their website, and have, while paid, certifications for web. So if we can't get the certs for free or at a discount, the students can still utilize those lessons and then choose for themselves if they want to go for the cert. If I were to recommend a time frame as to give an example to work upon, I would have HTML based lessons done by the end of freshman year, css lessons done by the end of sophomore year, and JavaScript done by the end of junior year with some time to spare. That time to spare could be utilized to either work on the certs, work on a project, or learn the next topic after JavaScript which would be frameworks. But if CPWD could even just cover JavaScript, especially since they learn about functions and object oriented programming in their sophomore year, then every student would be ready for web work immediately out of college, or if going to college, would already be through half of the curriculum, as most colleges get to Javascript at the end of the 2nd year. As for the other side of shop, the python and google cert are fine. But I do think there should be an emphasis on hardware, as everyone before leaving shop should have at least a general understanding of how a computer goes together, or how to set up a computer. So seeing an addition at some point during our time in shop that includes hardware in brief would be an outstanding improvement.
                <br><br>
                Now, moving from curriculum which could be difficult to change, there are things to keep in mind. First off, I do not envy you teachers for the situation you are in. With COVID, everything's been thrown out of whack, and will continue like this for a few more years. But that just means you must adapt and be flexible. And there is some improvement needed in this part. Being patient with the students, and holding their hands more, like what we discussed towards the beginning of the school year. Yes it sucks, yes it's more work for you, but in the long run will better prepare the students going forward. And this way of teaching should still be continued even after the COVID groups. Some kinds need more dependency on their teacher to learn, while others don't. You shouldn't dock grades just because someone needs more help than someone else. You should encourage the students to ask and encourage them to learn. Some kids just need that extra push and guidance from a teacher to then become an independent learner, and right now, that push doesn't seem to given. So going forward when teaching, ensure that you spend the extra time needed, and emphasis on helping the students that need that extra help. They are still high-schoolers after all, not full time employees. And secondly, listen to the students. We are going through CPWD to learn, and if we aren't satisfied we are going to complain. However, that doesn't mean you as teachers should say that those complaints don't mean anything as the students are lazy or whatever other excuse you use. The complaints are being said for a reason, at least hear them out. We genuinely want to improve the shop and learn all we can, so misconstruing that as laziness hinders CPWD from growing and improving. 
                <br><br>
                As for final thoughts, continue to reach out to us students, even after graduation. I know I will always be willing to help and give advice, and I know many of us share that feeling. So make sure to rely on us if you have questions or need a 2nd opinion. CPWD is a great shop and it can be improved to be the best, it just needs that push forward that keeps getting neglected. And with that, Essay over.
